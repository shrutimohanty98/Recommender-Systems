# Recommender Systems

In this project, we will build a recommendation system to predict the ratings of movies in the
provided dataset.

The increasing importance of the web as a medium for electronic and business transactions
and advertisement, and social media has served as a driving force behind the development of
recommender systems technology. Among the benefits, recommender systems provide a means
to prioritize data for each user from the infinite information available on the internet. Such
systems are critical to ensuring (among others): (a) the detection of hate speech, (b) user
retention on a web service, and (c) fast and high-quality access to relevant information. An
important catalyst is the ease with which the web enables users to provide feedback about a
small portion of the web that they traverse.

We explore collaborative filtering methods in this projet - Naive , model-based and neighborhood-based. 

This project is a part of Winter 2022 Course - Large Scale Data Mining (ECE 219)
